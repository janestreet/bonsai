"Bonsai!"
=========

Bonsai is a library that is used to build browser-based frontend applications
in OCaml.  It builds on top of the technology and lessons learned from
`Incr_dom` [^incr_dom], an incremental frontend framework.

# Getting Started

The [Getting Started with Bonsai](./docs/getting_started/open_source/index.md)
guide is good if you're new to web development entirely or just want
to see a walkthrough of a couple simple example apps.

Examples of using Bonsai in a web browser can be found in the
`examples` directory.

# Differences between Incr_dom and Bonsai

The main differences between `Incr_dom` and Bonsai are

- Bonsai has a notion of first-class components
- `Incr_dom` expects users to program in the `Incremental` monad; in Bonsai,
  incrementality is added for you under the hood -
  [read more](./docs/incrementality.md)
- Combining Bonsai components is easy

Similarities between `Incr_dom` and Bonsai:

- Both are built on top of Incremental library for performance optimizations
- Both make use of the `Vdom` library and associated helper libraries
  (`lib/vdom_input_widgets`, `lib/vdom_keyboard`, etc..) to help developers
  construct the view of the app.
- Bonsai components are embeddable inside of existing `Incr_dom` apps!
