# Bonsai


Bonsai is a library for building interactive browser-based UI.

The [Getting Started with Bonsai](./docs/getting_started/open_source/index.md)
guide is good if you're new to web development entirely or just want to see a
walkthrough of a couple simple example apps.

Examples of using Bonsai in a web browser can be found in the `examples`
directory.

## Docs

Documentation can be found in the [docs](./docs) directory, and API documentation
can be found in [src/bonsai.mli](./src/bonsai.mli).
