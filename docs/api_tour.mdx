<!--
This is a hack for hiding ocaml evaluation inside an MDX file.  The ocaml code
gets run (imports are added to the evaluation context), but the code is not
present in the output documents.

```ocaml
# open! Bonsai_mdx
```
-->

It is recommended that the reader of this documentation understand the concepts
explained in [The Bonsai Conceptual Model](./concepts.md).

The `bonsai` library is really just one big functor, but for web development
with Bonsai, we've instantiated this functor alongside some other helpers in
the `bonsai_web` library.  All examples that follow assume that the following modules
are open:

```ocaml
open! Core_kernel
open! Bonsai_web
```

Currently, there are no other instantiations of the Bonsai functor, but
`bonsai_vim`, `bonsai_emacs`, and `bonsai_term` are all potential long-term
projects that could be built on top of the core Bonsai library.


# Table Of Contents

Since the Bonsai library is primarily concerned with manipulating values of
type `Bonsai.t`,  the library can be broken up into several conceptual categories:

-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[**Constructors**](./constructors.mdx) Functions that produce `Bonsai.t` values
[**Combinators**](./combinators.mdx)   Functions that combine multiple `Bonsai.t` values into one
[**Projections**](./projections.mdx)   Functions that take exactly one `Bonsai.t` and produce a new `Bonsai.t` with different semantics
[**Collections**](./collections.mdx)   Functions that take exactly one `Bonsai.t` and project the `input` (or `model`) and the result over some collection.
