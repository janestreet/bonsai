This app just puts counters on the page, each with buttons to
increment and decrement the number.

## Building the example

You'll notice that there are two directories there: `bin/`, where the
`main.bc.js` file that you're building lives, and `lib/`, which houses
the important application code. As in [the "hello world"
example](./hello_world.mdx), the "app" consists of an *index.html*
page that includes the JS file for the app; the app is attached to the
"app" div on that page.

To run:

```sh skip
$ cd lib/bonsai/examples/counters/bin; python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000

## Your first components

In Bonsai, you'll hear a lot about "components." What is a component?

A component is an encapsulated bit of UI logic. It has **input** --
immutable data that comes from "outside" that component, say from
another component or from an RPC. It has a **model**, which is the
mutable internal state of that component. And it has a **result**,
which can be of any type, but eventually, for the top-level
component of your app, will include a `Vdom.Node.t`.

The clearest API for building a component is via
`Bonsai.of_module`. Inspecting its type, you can see that it takes a
module requiring these three parts: an input, a model, and a result:

```ocaml
# Bonsai.of_module0
- : (unit, 'm, 'a, 'r) Bonsai__Import.component_s ->
    default_model:'m -> 'r Bonsai.Computation.t
= <fun>
```

As examples, in the Counters app, the "Add Another Counter" button is
a component, and each counter--a number, plus two buttons to increment
and decrement it--is another component.

### Counter_component

<!-- If this code changes, consider changing the corresponding docs in
this and the next few sections! -->
```sh
$ sed -n -e '/\[CODE_EXCERPT_BEGIN 1\]/,/\[CODE_EXCERPT_END 1\]/p' ../../../examples/counters/lib/bonsai_web_counters_example.ml | tail -n +2 | head -n -2

module Action = struct
  type t =
    | Increment
    | Decrement
  [@@deriving sexp_of]
end

let single_counter =
  let%sub counter_state =
    Bonsai.state_machine0
      [%here]
      (module Int)
      (module Action)
      ~default_model:0
      ~apply_action:(fun ~inject:_ ~schedule_event:_ model -> function
        | Action.Increment -> model + 1
        | Action.Decrement -> model - 1)
  in
  return
  @@ let%map state, inject = counter_state in
  let button label action =
    let on_click = Vdom.Attr.on_click (fun _ -> inject action) in
    Vdom.Node.button [ on_click ] [ Vdom.Node.text label ]
  in
  Vdom.Node.div
    []
    [ button "-1" Action.Decrement
    ; Vdom.Node.text (Int.to_string state)
    ; button "+1" Action.Increment
    ]
;;
```

Here, the input is moot and we ignore it--for that, we use `()`. Its
model -- the component's state machine -- is an int. That's the number
we increment and decrement. Finally, its result is a `Vdom.Node.t`, the
little bit of DOM that renders that individual counter:

```html
<div>
  <button>-1</button>
  4
  <button>+1</button>
</div>
```

All of the interesting code here has to do with actions, which you can
think of as defining the state machine's transitions: here, just
`Increment` and `Decrement`.

**The compute function**

The compute function is the heart of the component. Its signature is:

```ocaml skip
val compute
  :  inject:(Action.t -> Ui_event.t)
  -> unit
  -> int
  -> Vdom.Node.t
```

The unit and int are the component's `'input` and `'model` types,
respectively, and the `Vdom.Node.t` is the component's `'result` type.

In other words, this is the function that takes the component's data
and renders its view. But what about `~inject`?

**The inject function**

`compute`'s inject function is just a callback that converts actions
into DOM events. These events are how Bonsai communicates to the
browser to actually do something when, say, a user clicks a
button. Here, we hook up the `"on_click'` attribute of the "+1" and
"-1" buttons to the corresponding DOM events:

```ocaml skip
let button label action =
  let on_click = Vdom.Attr.on_click (fun _ -> inject action) in
  Vdom.Node.button [ on_click ] [ Vdom.Node.text label ]
in
```

**The apply\_action function**

When an action is raised by a component via a `Ui_event.t`, Bonsai
will eventually pass that action back to the component's
`apply_action` function. This function is responsible for looking at
the model and the incoming action and producing a new model.

```ocaml skip
val apply_action
  :  inject:(Action.t -> Ui_event.t)
  -> schedule_event:(Ui_event.t -> unit)
  -> Input.t
  -> Model.t
  -> Action.t
  -> Model.t
```

During the transformation, the component can also emit more actions
via `schedule_event` or use Async to arrange for `schedule_event` to
be called later. (For this it will use the same `inject` callback as
before.) This enables quite a bit of UI dynamism. Here, we don't emit
any further actions; we just increment or decrement the model:

```ocaml skip
let apply_action ~inject:_ ~schedule_event:_ () model = function
  | Action.Increment -> model + 1
  | Action.Decrement -> model - 1
;;
```

**The name function**

This is just for debugging.

### Add\_counter\_component

<!-- If this code changes, consider changing the corresponding docs in
this and the next few sections! -->
```sh
$ sed -n -e '/\[CODE_EXCERPT_BEGIN 2\]/,/\[CODE_EXCERPT_END 2\]/p' ../../../examples/counters/lib/bonsai_web_counters_example.ml | tail -n +2 | head -n -2
module Model = struct
  type t = unit Int.Map.t [@@deriving sexp, equal]
end

let add_counter_component =
  let%sub add_counter_state =
    Bonsai.state_machine0
      [%here]
      (module Model)
      (module Unit)
      ~default_model:Int.Map.empty
      ~apply_action:(fun ~inject:_ ~schedule_event:_ model () ->
        let key = Map.length model in
        Map.add_exn model ~key ~data:())
  in
  return
  @@ let%map state, inject = add_counter_state in
  let on_click = Vdom.Attr.on_click (fun _ -> inject ()) in
  let view = Vdom.Node.button [ on_click ] [ Vdom.Node.text "Add Another Counter" ] in
  state, view
;;
```

The interesting part of this component is its use of the top-level
component's `Model` for its own. (Notice the module inclusion via `module
Model = Model`.) Why would we do that? And what is the "top-level
component" anyway?

In Bonsai, "everything is a component," including the app itself. That
is, the app that we'll attach to this example's *index.html* page is a
component made of other components. In that component, the model is a
map from ints to units. The keys are just indexes: 0, 1, 2, etc. And
each value in the map is a placeholder for one of the little gizmos
defined by the Counter\_component and added one at a time by pressing
the button defined by the Add\_counter\_component.

Notice that in the `apply_action` function immediately above, we just
initialize a new counter's model to `()` and set its index to the
current length of the map (a trick for getting auto-incrementing
indexes).

#### Using assoc_model to make a single component out of a map

Turning a map of individual counters into a single component that
governs all of them is easy in Bonsai. Indeed, this is where you start
seeing Bonsai's comparative advantage over Incr\_dom, our previous web
framework. Bonsai was designed precisely with this sort of
"projection" in mind.

All it takes is this bit of code:

```ocaml skip
let%sub counters =
  Bonsai.assoc (module Int) map ~f:(fun _key _data -> single_counter)
in
```

`let%sub` is a ppx for variable substitution, very similar to the standard
monadic `bind`, but with this signature:

```ocaml
# Bonsai.Let_syntax.Let_syntax.sub
- : 'a Bonsai.Computation.t ->
    f:('a Bonsai.Value.t -> 'b Bonsai.Computation.t) ->
    'b Bonsai.Computation.t
= <fun>
```

Then the `assoc` function is used to "project" the int map over the
counter component to yield a map of counter components. Its signature
is:

```ocaml
# Bonsai.assoc
- : ('key, 'cmp) Bonsai__Import.comparator ->
    ('key, 'data, 'cmp) Core_kernel.Map.t Bonsai.Value.t ->
    f:('key Bonsai.Value.t ->
       'data Bonsai.Value.t -> 'result Bonsai.Computation.t) ->
    ('key, 'result, 'cmp) Core_kernel.Map.t Bonsai.Computation.t
= <fun>
```

You can think of it as taking a single inner component and
"projecting" it into the map—i.e., returning a map-ish
supercomponent. The supercomponent can be used to easily add new
copies of the inner component (here, the individual counters), remove
them, count over them, etc.

Here, all we do with `counters` is take its `Map.data`--a list of
`Vdom.Node.t`'s--and plunk them in a div:

```ocaml skip
Vdom.Node.div [] [ add_button; Vdom.Node.div [] (Map.data counters) ]
```

#### Composing components using Bonsai.map2, sub, and the Let\_syntax

It all comes together in the last few lines of the program, which
produce our toplevel component:

<!-- If this code changes, consider changing the corresponding docs in
this and the next few sections! -->
```sh
$ sed -n -e '/\[CODE_EXCERPT_BEGIN 3\]/,/\[CODE_EXCERPT_END 3\]/p' ../../../examples/counters/lib/bonsai_web_counters_example.ml | tail -n +2 | head -n -2
let application =
  let open Bonsai.Let_syntax in
  let%sub add_counter = add_counter_component in
  let%pattern_bind map, add_button = add_counter in
  let%sub counters =
    Bonsai.assoc (module Int) map ~f:(fun _key _data -> single_counter)
  in
  return
  @@ let%map add_button = add_button
  and counters = counters in
  Vdom.Node.div [] [ add_button; Vdom.Node.div [] (Map.data counters) ]
;;
```

The application component is what we ultimately plug into the "app"
div of our *index.html* file. It's a `Vdom.Node.t
Bonsai.Computation.t`, i.e., its result is the DOM for the whole app.

You can get a better sense of how Bonsai's composition works by
looking at a de-sugared version of the `application` function:

```ocaml skip
let application_sugar_free =
  let open Bonsai.Let_syntax in
  Let_syntax.sub
    (Bonsai.of_module0 (module Add_counter_component) ~default_model:Model.default)
    ~f:(fun add_counter ->
      let map = Bonsai.Value.map add_counter ~f:(fun (map, _) -> map) in
      let add_button =
        Bonsai.Value.map add_counter ~f:(fun (_, add_button) -> add_button)
      in
      Let_syntax.sub
        (Bonsai.assoc (module Int) map ~f:(fun _key _data -> single_counter))
        ~f:(fun counters ->
          return
            (Bonsai.Value.map2 add_button counters ~f:(fun add_button counters ->
               Vdom.Node.div [] [ add_button; Vdom.Node.div [] (Map.data counters) ]))))
;;
```

The `Bonsai.Value.map` is used twice on the `add_counter` to
destructure its parts--the add button itself, and the map of
counters. The `Bonsai.assoc` projects the `single_counter` component
over this map. And finally, the `Bonsai.Value.map2` allows us to
combine components.
