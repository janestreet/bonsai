# Upgrading to Bonsai's local graph API

Bonsai's new local_ graph API is finally here!
We recommend looking through the[new mli file](https://cs/jane/lib/bonsai/src/cont.mli)
to see how types have changed.

 <!-- You can read more about it in
[this blog post](TBD) and [a new Bonsai guide](TBD). -->

## Moving from `Value`/`Computation` to `local_ Bonsai.graph` and `Bonsai.t`

You can convert your codebase to Bonsai's new API one file at a time!
The process is fairly mechanical and straightforward:

1. Replace any `open! Bonsai_web` with `open! Bonsai_web.Cont`
2. Rename any `'a Value.t` to `'a Bonsai.t`
3. Rename any `'a Computation.t` to `local_ Bonsai.graph -> 'a Bonsai.t`
4. For the most part, `let%sub` is no longer needed. Instead, instantiate Bonsai
   components by passing `graph` to them.
5. `let%arr`s don't need to be modified at all. They work like fancy `let%map`s. See below
   for more discussion on this topic.
6. Components can now return tuples / records of `Bonsai.t`s! If you were previously
   returning `('a * 'b) Bonsai.t`, consider returning `(a Bonsai.t * 'b Bonsai.t)` instead.
   This is because we no longer need `let%sub`, so there's no longer anything enforcing
   that our components must return a single `Computation.t`.

Any Bonsai component that uses Bonsai primitives, either directly or transitively, will
need a `local_ graph` parameter. This is fine and expected.

If anything breaks or you're unsure of something, please reach out!

## let%map vs let%arr

You might have noticed that we have removed all of the `let%sub`s but still have `let%arr`s.
Previously `let%map`s were always considered harmful, and in the `local_ graph` that's no
longer the case! `let%map` and `let%arr` have the same type and can be used interchangebly
in the simple case of `let%map_or_arr foo = foo in`. This is incredibly nice for newcomers
who are familiar with `let%map` from the various common monads which support it. That said,
`let%arr` still has some fancy support for incremental computation built in!

`let%arr` has performance benefits over `let%map` when you are pattern matching:
`let%arr { a; _ } = r` will only trigger incremental updates when `a` changes, while
`let%map` will trigger when any field in `r` changes. As a guideline: if anything on the
left side of your `let%arr`s is a pattern with ignored parts (e.g. `let%arr a, _ = ...`;
`let%arr {a; _} = ...`), keep them as `let%arr`s for now.

## Patterns

We continue to recommend splitting non-trivial stateful components up into modular pieces
when possible. This should be even more flexible with the `local_ graph` API.

It's also often good practice to split the part of your component that generates vdom
view into a separate, pure OCaml function.

More pattterns to come soon!

## API Changes

Alongside the new `local_ graph` API, we'd like to do some housekeeping on the APIs Bonsai
provides, and how they are organized. Some of these are new features that are now
possible because of `local_ graph`, others are just cleanup we've been meaning to do for
a while.

### Changed

* `Bonsai.yoink` -> `Bonsai.peek`: still uses the same api (with graph changes) - just a
  new name! Peek is a better representation of what is happening and is more inline with
  what this operation is called on other data structures (stacks, Deferred.t, Mvar.t, etc).
* Most `Bonsai.Value.t` combinators are now available directly in the `Bonsai` module for
  use with `Bonsai.t`s.

### Removed

Many combinators for dealing with `Bonsai.Value.t` and `Bonsai.Computation` are no longer
needed, and are not included in the new API. If you think we've forgotten something useful,
please reach out!

### Known Issues

#### Top-level `match%sub`

Top-level `match%sub`'s raise an exception on app startup. For example:

__Raises__:

```ocaml skip
let component =
  match%sub ... with
  | ... -> ...
```

__OK__:

```ocaml skip
let component (local_ graph) =
  match%sub ... with
  | ... -> ...
```

__OK__:
(if only called from inside a Bonsai context)

```ocaml skip
let component () =
  match%map ... with
  | ... -> ...
```

__OK__:

```ocaml skip
let component =
  match%map ... with
  | ... -> ...
```
