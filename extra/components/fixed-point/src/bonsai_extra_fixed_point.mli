(** [with_inject_fixed_point] allows an injection function produced as the result of a
    computation to be used as the input of that same combination. This "tie-the-knot"
    operation is legal because actions are scheduled independently of computation
    evaluation, allowing us to break what seems like a dependency loop.

    However, it is important that the input injection function isn't the same one that is
    returned by the computation (or even a component of the returned injection function).
    If that happens, an action being triggered will cause an inifinite loop to occur in
    the action scheduler. *)

(** [with_self_effect] gives access to an effect which produces the output ['a] within the
    body of [f]. This can be useful if you'd like to install an effect handling function
    on [f] whose logic depends on its current value. *)
