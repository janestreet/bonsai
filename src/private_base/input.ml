(* This type represents a combination of static and dynamic data. When only one
   is present, the representation is straightforward, but when both are
   present, we use the [Join] constructor. [Join] contains the dynamic portion
   as a single incremental node (which probably contains a tuple-tree built up
   with several [both] nodes), and the static portion is contained implicitly
   within the function, call it [f]. [f] rearranges the ['a] by inserting all
   the pieces of static data into their appropriates places in the tuple tree. *)
